## 📦 What Are Repack Games?

Repack games are just regular PC games that have been compressed to make them smaller in size. That means you don’t have to download a huge file. Nothing important is removed. The game still works just like the original.

People who don’t have fast internet or have low storage often use repack games. Some players also use them to test a game before deciding if they want to buy the full version.

## 🎮 Can You Download Steam Games for Free?

Keep in mind, it's always best to support the developers when you can. But trying a game first or testing your system with a repack is very common in the gaming world.
